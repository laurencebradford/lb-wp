This is an adaption of the WP BOOTSTRAP theme. 
===================
[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form. 

Used Eddie Machado's Bones for a starting point (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) but it doesn't look too much like it any longer. 

Adaptation

made by Laurence Bradford.

GETTING STARTED

To get started, open Terminal or a command prompt and run:

cd path/to/wp-content/themes
git clone https://github.com/laurencebradford/lb-wp.git
npm install
grunt watch

Page Templates
______________

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site - http://www.320press.com/wp-bootstrap)
    - Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page


Shortcodes
__________

We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Bootstrap.

Sidebars
________

There are two different sidebars. One for the homepage and one for the other pages. Add widgets to them.
